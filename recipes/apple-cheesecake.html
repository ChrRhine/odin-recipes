      </ul>
      <li>Topping:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cups apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped pecans</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
      <li>To make the crust: Mix graham cracker crumbs, pecans, melted butter,
        sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well combined. Press into
        the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven; 
        leave the oven on.
      </li>
      <li>To make the filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar in a mixing bowl
        with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add eggs, one al
        a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract. 
        Pour filling into the baked crust.
      </li>
      <li>To make the topping: Place apples in a bowl. Stir sugar and cinnamon
        together in a smaller bowl; pour over apples and toss to coat. Spoon
        sugared apples over filling, then sprinkle pecans over top.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the oven until edges are puffed, 60 to 70 minutes. Run the
        tip of a table knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a
        wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature, about
        1 hour. Refrigerate until completely chilled, 4 hours to overnight.
